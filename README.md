I am a Senior Research Software Engineers (SRSE) based at the University of Warwick Information and Digital Group (IDG). I work directly with <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/research/digitalhumanities/team/">e-research team</a> and world-leading academics in both the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/">Faculty of Arts</a> (which includes five top 10 UK departments in their REF unit of assessment), and the newly established <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cdi/">Centre for Digital Inquiry (CDI)</a>. The e-research team is part of the Information and Digital Group (IDG) at the University of Warwick.

<p>My academic background is interdisciplinary in nature cutting across Geographic Information Science/Systems (GISc/GIS) and advanced geospatial applications (PhD), Geocomputation in Social Science research (Post-doc, PhD), Computer Science (MSc), Geoinformatics and Photogrammetry (MSc), and Geomatic/Geodetic Engineering (BSc). Prior to joining IDG, I worked in two Warwick research centres as a Senior Research Fellow where I led the development of geospatial research methods. Prior to joining Warwick, I worked in several roles in the UK, Germany, and Ghana (West Africa). I worked as Research Fellow in two academic institutions in the UK (University of Aberdeen, De Montfort University), Software Engineer in Germany as well as Geomatic Engineer and Lecturer in Ghana.</p>

The following are key areas of interest: 
<ul>
    <li>Geographic Information Systems/Science (GIS/GISc) and related research</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence: Machine learning and archival images & Natural language processing (particularly text mining)</li>
    <li>Digital Humanities (intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities)</li>
    <li>Critical data studies (systematic study of data and its criticisms)</li>
    <li>Critical software studies (systematic study of software and its criticisms). Particularly exploring inequalities, sustainability, and ethics of software development processes & GIS applications.</li>
    <li>Collaboration with researchers through funding and PhD/MSc supervision</li>
</ul>
